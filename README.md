# catan-dice

A simple utility to roll dice for a game of Catan.

One of the chief complaints about the game of Catan is that the results from dice rolls can differ significantly from the theoretical frequency. This tool build a 'deck' of die rolls and consumes every card in the deck before reconstructing it, thus ensuring that the actual results converge with the theoretical odds every 36 rolls.
